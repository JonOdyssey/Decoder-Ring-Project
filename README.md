# Decoder-Ring-Project

Project aims to build an application that will help encode and decode all kinds of fun messages!
The three forms of encoding are:
1. Caesar shift
2. Polybius square
3. Substitution cipher

This project is designed to test your ability to build complex algorithms.
It will also test your ability to write unit tests with Mocha and Chai to test your algorithms.

Currently, the substitution cipher rejects any and all special characters.
A future version will rectify this.
